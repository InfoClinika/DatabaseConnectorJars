I'm putting the JAR dependencies of the DatabaseConnector package into this separate package, as suggested in the CRAN Repository Policy.

---

## Test environments
* Ubuntu 14.04.5 LTS (Travis), R 3.4.4
* Windows 7, R 3.4.4

## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. There is one note because the java directory is 15.8Mb.

## Downstream dependencies

There are currently no downstream dependencies. When this package is accepted in CRAN, we will submit the DatabaseConnector package which requires this package.
